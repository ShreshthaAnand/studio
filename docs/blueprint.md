- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). This almost-white shade complements the pastel blue without overwhelming it.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#E59866) for interactive elements like buttons.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for both headlines and body, due to its modern yet warm feel suitable for all text elements.
- Use simple, universally recognizable icons that are easy to understand for users of all abilities.
- Maintain a clean and straightforward layout with large, clearly labeled buttons and ample spacing for ease of use.
- Use subtle and non-distracting animations, such as gentle fading or scaling, to provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction.
